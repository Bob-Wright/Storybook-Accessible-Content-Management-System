	<p>As explained above, this installation of Storybook Comic Book Builder is intended as an online tool to enable a user to create and subsequently download a ZIP archive containing all the content for a web Comic. The user can then unZip the archive to display and use the web gallery they made. In this mode Storybook Comic Book Builder does not save any content from users, and in fact it deletes the ZIP archive after a timeout delay.<br>
	Another way to use Storybook Comic Book Builder is as a locally installed tool to make and display web Comic pages which are then hosted and displayed on the site where Storybook Comic Book Builder is installed. There is a lovely term about software, "eat your own dogfood", and I use Storybook Comic Book Builder in that mode to create Comic pages that I display on my own domain. To do this you can download and install your own copy of Storybook Comic Book Builder. Then, for example, this could be used by a school or other organization with a web domain to allow students or members to build and upload galleries of their graphics work to be displayed on the organization's web site.</p> <p><em>Knowledge and Information is power.</em> Power will get you freedom.
