	<p>Storybook Comic Book Builder is installed on this site as a tool to create web Comic pages which are then hosted and displayed on the site. In this mode Storybook Comic Book Builder could be used by a school or other organization with a web domain to allow students or members to build and upload galleries of their images to be displayed on the organization's web site. There is a lovely term about software, "eat your own dogfood", and I use Storybook Comic Book Builder in that mode to create Comic pages that I display on my own domain.<br>
	Alternatively Storybook Comic Book Builder may be installed as an online tool to enable a user to create and subsequently download a ZIP archive containing all the content for a web Comic. The user can then unZip the archive to display and use the web gallery they made. In this mode Storybook Comic Book Builder does not save any content from users, and in fact it deletes the ZIP archive after a timeout delay. Storybook Comic Book Builder uses PHP and mySQLi and other software to generate the Comic pages; however the generated web code, the gallery that Storybook Comic Book Builder makes and downloads, is all plain HTML, CSS, and javascript so it will run on most any host or media with most browsers. The Comic uses "responsive design" to allow it to be used on various screen sizes from smartphones to desktops.</p>
