By 1980 the levels of greenhouse gases had climbed far higher than anything seen for many millions of years, and by the start of the 21st century, it was clear that there was a major connection between global temperature and greenhouse gas levels. Our addition of these gases to the atmosphere was initiating a warming process, with temperature rise lagging a few years behind the rising gas levels. Drying forests and warmer seawater were getting less efficient at taking carbon dioxide out of the air, and methane was bubbling up in Arctic wetlands. Burnt forests were even less efficient than those merely drying.

The geological record gave a striking verification that throughout the Pleistocene epoch, the greenhouse gas feedback had turned Earth's orbital cycles from minor climate variations to grand transformations that affected all life on the planet. Even so, emissions were surging far more rapidly than anything in the record. 

Now the computer models, with wholly independent methods and data, were predicting processes that would bring a rapid and severe global warming â€” a disruption of climate exceeding anything seen since the emergence of the human species. The models said the threshold for dangerous global warming would be crossed between 2027 and 2042. This was the milieu that would see the advent of BioMechaGenics (BMG) Enhanced.
