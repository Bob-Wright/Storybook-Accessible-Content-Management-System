Meanwhile at the beginning of the twenty-first century feedback effects were beginning to kick in, feedbacks that were accelerating dramatic climate change. These warming changes were not prompted by variations in sunlight as had previous changes but instead were prompted by changes in atmospheric gas content, and predicting likelihoods was problematic. Still, it is certain that some government agencies and a few NGO's had anticipated the high probability of extreme climate and environmental changes along with catastrophic collateral socioeconomic impacts. To what extent their subsequent behaviors and actions were influenced by these assumptions is moot.
