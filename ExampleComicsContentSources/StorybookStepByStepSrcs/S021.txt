Each page or image in the comic may have an alternate image to display if the page image or a "play arrow" is clicked. In the example comic the alternate images are GIF slideshow animations. In addition to an alternate image, each panel or page may have an associated audio soundtrack, and the audio may be muted or unmuted by viewer choice. (Note that while audio is supported the dialog to select and upload that content is not yet included in the Builder.)
