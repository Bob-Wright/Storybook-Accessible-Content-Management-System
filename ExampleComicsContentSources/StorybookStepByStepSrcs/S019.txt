In order for Storybook Comic Book Builder to include "alt text" with a Comic image, a text file must be uploaded for each image. The alt text filename must match the associated image filename.
Storybook Comic Builder suggests the inclusion of alt text for the images displayed in a Comic. Including this alternate text helps to provide information about the images to the audience, and greatly improves accessibility. Text content is also important for SEO or Search Engine Optimization. The best alt text for search engines and viewers alike provides meaningful content about the associated image.
