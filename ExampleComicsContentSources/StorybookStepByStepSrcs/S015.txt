Now we have a sequence of dialogs which will let you select and upload the comic contents proper.

This first dialog, the Comic Image Files Upload page, gathers the images that comprise each page in the comic. Following are two screens that show the progress of some uploads followed by a third screen that shows the dialog itself satisfies the WebAIM evaluation for WCAG compliance.

If we wish to show only an optional caption text with NO image we use a special image of 1 pixel by 1 pixel in size. This allows us to create documents that are largely text panels without images.
