This screen along with the three following illustrate the process of selecting and uploading two of the images used by Storybook to create the comic. One image is optional, that being a background image which will appear behind each panel or page in the comic. The other image is required, that being the image used on the gallery card which will be displayed in the Comic Book Gallery. After each upload completes, click "Next" in the footer at the bottom of that dialog to return to the Comic Book builder page.
We can also see that these two dialogs used by the Storybook application satisfy the WebAIM evaluation for accessibility.
