Here is what I did for my first Bootstrap project. It is an online comic books gallery design, and the gallery includes an active demo for one of the online comic books. It leverages Bottstrap's responsive design facilities, and I used the free MDB version.



The next step is to write up the philosophy of the design, why you might want landscape vs portrait pages for your comic (or vice versa) and a very brief description of the template layout/design concepts for the comics and set that up for web display. We'll mention SEO and the importance of text and semantic content.



Probably while I am doing that I will build out the Linux folder structure with owners and permissions and groups to allow the relatively secure upload and storage of user content. Do not let users upload content to your web page. That is the corollary to Rule #1 for web design, "Never trust a user."



Then I get to reward myself by coding up the "Comic Book Builder App" to allow users to create their own comics by uploading content and choosing some options like color schemes, The builder code isn't rocket appliances, but I get a kick out of replacing myself with software. Cheers, and all of you be safe stay well and have fun! ☺
